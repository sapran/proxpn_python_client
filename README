# proxpn_python_client

When executed, this script will present you a list of proXPN servers all around
the world. Once you select one, an openvpn connection will be established.

Note that if you are not a premium subscriber, you won't be able to use all of
these servers. ProXPN offers a great (and cheap!) service. I highly recommend
them :)

A few things that are worth mentioning:

  * All this script does is:
    1) Download an up-to-date list of proXPN servers
    2) Make you choose one
    3) Call 'openvpn' with the appropiate parameters

  * This means you must have 'openvpn' installed before executing this script.
    In Archlinux that's "pacman -S openvpn"... and I imagine in other Linux
    distros it will be something similar.

  * When 'openvpn' is called, 'sudo' will be prepended... This means you don't
    need to execute this script as root: it will ask for your 'sudo' password
    just before executing 'openvpn' (which is the only binary which will run
    with elevated privileges)

  * The 'install.sh' script contained in this folder does the following things:
    1) Copy 'proxpn.py' to '/usr/local/bin'
    2) Create folder '~/.proxpn'
    3) Copy 'proxpn.ovpn' to '~/.proxpn'

  * The 'proxpn.ovpn' file is a standard 'openvpn' configuration file that is
    included in the ProXPN Windows/MAC installation packages.
    I guess it is perfectly OK for me to include it here as it just contains
    a public certificate and some 'openvpn' configuration options.

  * The first time you execute this script it will download the list of VPN
    servers from ProXPN's web page. This list will then be saved into the
    '~/.proxpn' folder for future invocations. If you want to force a
    re-download of this file, use the '-f' argument when executing this script.

  * The first time you execute this script it will ask for you login credentials
    abd save them into the '~/.proxpn' folder for future invocations. If you
    want to enter a new login/password, use the '-r' argument when executing
    this script.
    NOTE: The file where these credentials are saved is actually called
    '~/.proxpn/auth.conf' and is created with read/write permissions for you
    only. However they are stored in plain text... keep this in mind as you
    might not feel comfortable with it.

  * ProXPN offers both TCP and UDP openvpn tunnels. By default all of them are
    shown to you when executing this script. If you are just interested in a
    particular type, use '-u' (UDP) or '-t' (TCP) when executing this script.
